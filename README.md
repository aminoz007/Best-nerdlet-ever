# Best-nerdlet-ever

Overview
Our goal is to create a landing page for Riot service owners to view data relevant to their service. Riot uses an RFC190 Scope to address its deployments (ex. globalriot.las2.deployment1.game.server); this page will capture data from NewRelic custom logs and metrics relevant to the specified scope and present it to the user. This Nerdlet is scoped to handling custom logs/metrics only for now, but can be expanded if time allows.
